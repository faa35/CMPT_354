# Database Systems I - Initial Setup

This repository provides the initial setup instructions for the **Database Systems I** course. The setup includes installing the required tools and verifying the environment to ensure a smooth learning experience.

## Overview

In this course, we use **SQLite** as the database management system (DBMS). Unlike traditional client-server DBMSs (e.g., MySQL, Oracle), SQLite is embedded directly into applications. This unique feature makes it lightweight, portable, and widely adopted in billions of applications.

The tools you'll set up are:
1. **Jupyter Notebook** - An interactive coding and documentation environment.
2. **SQLite** - A lightweight, self-contained database system.
3. **JupySQL** - A library that integrates SQL functionality into Jupyter Notebook.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following are installed:
- Python 3.12 or later (via **Anaconda** distribution is recommended).

---

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook is an open-source tool that allows you to create and share live code, visualizations, and documentation in a single interface.

1. **Download and Install Anaconda:**
   - Visit the [Anaconda Download Page](https://www.anaconda.com/) and download the latest version of **Anaconda Python 3.12**.
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Open **Anaconda Navigator** or type `jupyter notebook` in the terminal/command prompt to start Jupyter.

---

### Step 2: Install SQLite

SQLite is the database management system used in this course.

- **MacOS/Linux:**
  - SQLite is typically pre-installed. Verify by opening a terminal and typing:
    ```bash
    sqlite3
    ```
  - To exit SQLite, type:
    ```bash
    .exit
    ```

- **Windows:**
  1. Download SQLite command-line tools from the [SQLite Download Page](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html).
  2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file and place the contents in a directory (e.g., `C:\sqlite`).
  3. Add the directory to your system's PATH for easier access.

To verify the installation, open the terminal/command prompt and type:
```bash
sqlite3
```
If you see the SQLite shell prompt, the installation is successful.

---

### Step 3: Install JupySQL

JupySQL is a library that integrates SQL functionality into Jupyter Notebook.

1. Open the **Anaconda Prompt**.
2. Install JupySQL by running:
   ```bash
   conda install jupysql -c conda-forge
   ```

---

### Step 4: Initial Test

Verify your setup by running the test notebook.

1. **Download `test.ipynb`:**
   - Obtain the test notebook (`test.ipynb`) and the expected output file from the course resources.
   
2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Navigate to the directory containing the `test.ipynb` file in the terminal and run:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Alternatively, upload the file via the Jupyter Notebook interface.

3. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Open `test.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Run each cell in order by pressing `Shift + Enter`.
   - Compare the output with the expected results provided in the course materials.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **SQLite not recognized in the terminal:**
  - Ensure SQLite is added to your system PATH (Windows users).
- **JupySQL installation issues:**
  - Verify that you're using the correct Anaconda environment by running:
    ```bash
    conda activate base
    ```
